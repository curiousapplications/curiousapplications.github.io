      heading: Great new apps!
      text: From startups to internal enterprise apps, we love creating value for our clients.

      heading: Legacy Updates
      text:  Have an app that needs some love? We can help you update and fix issues with your existing app.  Anyone can start a new app, but without proper discipline, projects hit a wall from technical debt.  We help clients get back on track by simplifying what they have, and adding new features at an increased velocity.

    - heading: Communication
      text: The most important aspect to delivering value on a budget is doing the right thing with the time you have. We work with clients to determine which features are core, which need to be explored, and which can come later. We focus on the needs of today, with a plan for tomorrow!
    - heading: Discipline
      text:  Simplicity begets velocity. From our experience in rescuing legacy apps, the common thread was the cost of hastily made decisions.  Our secret sauce? Reduce complexity! We start every app with forethought for future needs, and dedication to keeping things clean.  
    - heading: Technology
      text: From our dedication to the craft, we filter every decision we make through a feedback loop.  We use Swift, MVVM, unidirectional flow, reactive techniques, code generation, and micro libraries for layout, data bindings and UI controls.  We leverage the gains from our commitment to judgement and simplicity.

      title: Methodist Healthcare
      text: Methodist Healthcare needed an application to help them track patient and hospital data.  The result was the pinnacle of all our experience, a hybridized real & mock data model that provided clean internal interfaces for generated model code while allowing uninterrupted client side improvements, clever and minimal micro libraries for deep view linking, UI layout, reactive data bindings, and context free UI controls.

      title: Ava
      text: Ava is the creator of the groundbreaking Ava app that helps deaf people participate in group conversations. They needed needed extra help in getting their iOS app caught up with their Android app. We worked with them to simplify what they had, migration to modern techniques, and build a solid foundation for more rapid development.  In doing so, the iOS app became their lead development platform.  Ava launched to the public and scaled to over 100K users within two weeks.
