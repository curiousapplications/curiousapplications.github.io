Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare hired us to build an app to help them achieve higher efficiency in their organization. We achieved this with modern functional reactive techniques, code generation, powerful view routing techniques, clean internal modeling to avoid vendor lock-in, and careful structuring to allow them to deploy subsets of the app to other devices. The result with a small, agile codebase that scales both up and down, solving not just their current needs, but laying the foundation for future projects.
