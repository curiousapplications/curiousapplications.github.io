Twine hired us to help augment their team, and ensure a successful beta launch of their app.  They also wanted incremental progress on analytics.  What we delivered instead, was code generation driven from their spreadsheet based specification. This generated the boiler plate for all their present and future needs, and eliminated what would have been months of painstaking work. It also allowed them to add and migrate new concerns with complete confidence that any issue in the client code would be caught immediately, eliminating the possibility of an all to common class of bugs.  The result?  Accelerated development schedule, and another happy client.
