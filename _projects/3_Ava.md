Ava is the creator of the groundbreaking Ava app that helps deaf people participate in group conversations. Ava hired us to get their iOS app development back on schedule. We worked with them to simplify what they had, and migrate to modern techniques to lay the foundation for more rapid development.  The iOS app became the lead development platform.  Ava launched to the public and scaled successfully to over 100K users within two weeks.
